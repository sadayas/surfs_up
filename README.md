# Surf's Up Analysis

## Overview
For this analysis, we will be using Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy to help filter through the data.  With the use of these tools, we are able to determine the weather of Oahu on the months of June and December.  W. Avy will have a clear picture to decide if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable in Oahu.


## Result
In our analysis, we can determine a few differences during the month of June and December.

In our following image as a key:

1. June has a higher minimum of temperature than December.
	-June is at 64 degrees, while December is at 56 degrees.

2. The average temperature in June is at 74 degrees. Almost 5 degrees higher than  December, which is at 71 Degrees.

3. There is a higher frequency of 70+ degree weather in June than it is in December.



## Summary
With the completion of our June and December analysis, we are able to determine the difficulty of having the shop all year long.  While the weather in Oahu stays warm through the year, there may be issues during December.  In June, the shop will flourish with the warmer temperatures, and the frequency of warmer temperatures are higher in this month.  The cooler weather in December may discourage customers from purchasing ice cream, or even ending out to the beach.

A few more queries to perform, is to determining which stations recorded the warmer weather.  With this data, we can pinpoint the best location for the ice cream shop.  Another query, is finding out which other months are warmer, to decide if the shop should be kept open. We can then plot all the queries to see which months will work the best.
